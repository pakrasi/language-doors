# Brief: write data/<lang>.json for one language

You are filling one language's content for a static language-learning website called "Doors and Glue". The site has one language-neutral master file, `data/framework.json`, and one file per language. Your job is the language file. Read the master first: `cat data/framework.json` (it is ~60KB; read it all).

## The framework in one paragraph

A **door** is a verb frame with one open slot ("I want to ___"). A **turn** rotates a door through time, polarity and mood. **Glue** is connectors and prepositions plus the word-order rule each triggers. **Slot grammar** is what happens inside the slot (pronouns, articles, gender, case, agreement). **Functions** are what you are doing (decline, suggest, complain). **Chunks** are fixed phrases with no slot. **Lexicon** is topic vocabulary. **Sound** is pronunciation and listening. A CEFR level is a slice through all layers. A **scenario** is a situation plus a task; the learner must produce one or two sentences, then compares with a model answer that is broken into colour-coded blocks by layer.

## Output file

Write `data/<lang>.json` (lang id from `framework.json.languages[].id`). UTF-8, valid JSON. Shape:

```json

### Layer-specific rules for `items`
- **door / chunk / glue**: `target` is the chunk with `___` for the slot. `example` is a full natural sentence using it. `note` says the word-order or case rule and the most common learner error. Put verb+preposition and case information in `note`.
- **turn**: `target` is the form pattern (e.g. "haben/sein + Partizip II"), `example` one sentence, `note` what the tense actually means in this language if it differs from English.
- **slot**: `target` is the paradigm in compact form (e.g. "ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie/Sie"), `example` one sentence, `note` the rule. If the feature does not exist (e.g. gender in Khasi is different, articles in Hindi), say so in `target` ("not applicable: ...") and use `example` to show what the language does instead.
- **function**: `target` is the 1-2 most useful chunks for that function, separated by " / ". `example` one exchange or sentence. `note` which items (by id) the recipe usually uses.
- **lexicon**: `target` is a comma-separated list of 12-16 core words for that topic with gloss in parentheses each, e.g. "der Bahnhof (station), die Fahrkarte (ticket), ...". No example needed. `gloss` can be the topic name.
- **sound**: `target` names the features, `gloss` explains for an English speaker, no example needed.
- Register: where the language has formal/informal address, show the informal form first and the formal after " / " when the chunk differs.

### Scenarios
- Model answers must be natural, spoken-register, level-appropriate, and must use the recipe items listed in the framework for that scenario (at least the doors and glue). One to three sentences.
- Breakdown blocks: use layer `door`, `glue`, `chunk`, `turn` for pieces that correspond to framework items (set `id`); use layer `filler` for slot contents and other words (no `id`). Punctuation attaches to the neighbouring block. The concatenation check is strict: copy the text exactly.
- `label` is short: the id plus optional turn annotation like "· past · neg".
- For non-Latin scripts, `translit` on model is required; breakdown text stays in native script.

### Length limits (the site shows cards at a glance; long text is a bug)
- `note`: at most 2 short sentences, under 220 characters. One rule or one trap, not both.
- `example.target`: one sentence, under 90 characters. `gloss` under 90 characters.
- `target` chunk: under 70 characters; give at most two alternatives separated by " / ".
- Scenario `model.target`: one or two sentences, under 160 characters. `tip`: one sentence.
- `notes.*`: keep to the sentence counts given above.

### Quality bar
- Write as a native-speaker teacher would. No machine-translation stiffness. Prefer what people actually say over textbook forms, and say so in notes when they differ (e.g. Hindi spoken forms, Arabic MSA vs Levantine, Brazilian vs European Portuguese).
- Every note must teach something: a rule, a trap, or a contrast with English. No filler like "This is commonly used."
- Non-Latin scripts: translit is for reading aloud, not scholarly. Hindi/Bengali: simple roman with long vowels marked by doubling or macron consistently. Arabic: standard chat-style or DIN-like, consistent within the file.
- Arabic: forms in MSA; in `note` give the Levantine spoken equivalent when it differs (e.g. "بدي" for "أريد"). Mark "rtl" is handled by the site, do nothing special.
- Khasi: this is a low-resource language. Use the standard Sohra-based written Khasi (as in Khasi textbooks and the Bible translation orthography). Be conservative: prefer forms you are confident are correct; for advanced C1 rhetorical doors that Khasi expresses differently, describe the Khasi strategy in `target` and give a real sentence. Gender markers (u/ka/i/ki) are central to slot grammar; treat them carefully.
- Do not invent items or scenarios. Cover all 284 items and all 30 scenarios.

## Validate before you finish
Run `python3 scripts/validate.py data/<lang>.json` and fix every reported problem. Repeat until it prints OK. Do not report done until it prints OK. Then reply with: the validator's OK line, the star count, and 3-5 sentences on any judgement calls (variety, register, items where the language has no direct equivalent).

Write the file with a single Write call if possible (it will be 80-150KB). If you must build it in parts, assemble with a small Python script and delete the parts.
